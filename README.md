This is early development extension. We don't guarantee anything about this extension so please use at your own risk. Currently, we focus developing inkporter on linux as primary system, so if you use MacOS or Windows forgive us if we can't provide full features of Inkporter. The main problem is dependencies installation for each operating system is different, so it effect to inkporter features.
